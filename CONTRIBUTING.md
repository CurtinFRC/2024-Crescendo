# Contributing to our 2024 Codebase. 
Our 2024 Codebase is split up into two main projects, our robot code and our library Wombat. This will only focus on our robot code but if you our on programming team it is recomended that you also read the contributing guide for Wombat. This guide assumes you have already read the README.md.   

## Creating Issues
Issues should be created to report bugs or request features. Use the appropriate template for your issue and make sure to apply the appropriate labels. If you are working on an issue assign yourself to the issue or request to be assigned to it if you do not have write access. 

## Creating Pull Requests
Pull requests should be created to resolve issues. Reference the issue you are resolving in your pull request. Pull requests are required to pass ci, follow formatting rules and pass reviews. 

## Wombat Contributions
Wombat contributions are expected to follow the guidelines set out in the contributing guide for Wombat. All Wombat changes during build season will be periodically reviewed and merged into a seperate branch of Wombat during build season. Outside of build season it will be less periodically merged in but will be directly merged to master. This is not something that needs to be kept track of by you as a contributor.
